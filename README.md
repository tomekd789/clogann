CloGANN: Clojure abstraction for breeding (Recurrent) Neural Networks (NN) with the Genetic Algorithm (GA).
To be used for indirect programming by breeding neural networks capable of resolving user-defined problems.

I haven't found any abstraction like this on the GitHub, then I am happy to provide one. :)

## Installation

Important Notice: this is not a library, but a complete running program.
No installation is needed. The project requires two files to work: core.clj, and population.clj.

## Usage

Download at least the two files mentioned above.
if you plan to play with the ready example provided, create a folder named 'factorization'.
Read the original 'population.clj' file for details.

The population.clj file contains a simple problem definition as a usage example.
You need to replace it by self-defined values by editing the file.
The core.clj is not expected to be altered under normal circumstances.

Then run core.clj in the way you prefer (REPL, compiled to the Java bytecode, etc.).
